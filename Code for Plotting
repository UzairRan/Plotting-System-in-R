Plotting System in R
## Base plot

library(datasets)
data(cars)
with(cars, plot(speed, dist))

## Lattice plot

library(lattice)
state <- data.frame(state.x77, region = state.region)
xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout = c(4,1))

## ggplot2 plot

library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)

### Now go in detail of these plotting systems
## BASE PLOTTING SYSTEM

library(datasets)
hist(airquality$Ozone)  ## Draw a histogram(simple base graphics)

library(datasets)
with(airquality, plot(Wind,Ozone))  ## scatterplot(simple base graphics)
with(airquality, plot(Wind,Ozone, pch = 25, col = 'orange'))  ## to add colour

library(datasets)
airquality <- transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, airquality, xlab = "Month", ylab = "Ozone(ppb)")  ## Boxplot(simple base graphics)

### Base Plot with Annotation

library(datasets)
with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone))
title(main = " Ozone and Wind in new York city") ## add a title
with(subset(airquality, Month == 5), points(Wind, Ozone, col = "blue"))
with(subset(airquality, Month != 5), points(Wind, Ozone, col = "red"))
legend("topright", pch = 1, col = c("blue", "red"), legend = c("May", "Other Months")) 

### BASE PLOT WITH REGRESSION LINE
